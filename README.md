# MiPark

## About the Project

MiPark is a revolutionary application that transforms the way we manage and utilize parking spaces. By enabling garage owners to rent out their unused spaces, MiPark offers an innovative solution to the chronic lack of parking in urban areas and encourages more efficient use of available resources.

## Social and Economic Benefits

- **For Owners:** Generate additional income by renting out unused parking spaces.
- **For Drivers:** Save time and reduce the stress associated with parking search.
- **Environmental Impact:** Reduce traffic congestion in search of parking, contributing to the decrease in CO2 emissions.

## Technologies Used

- **.NET MAUI:** Microsoft framework that allows the creation of cross-platform applications for Android and iOS.
- **OpenStreetMap:** Used for GPS integration and searching for nearby garages.
- **Security:** Implementation of cryptography for user passwords.
